### üê± About Me 
I'm August, a second year Computer Science and Classics student at UMass Amherst. I have a diversity of interests (including, besides CS, pedagogy and Augustan era poetry), but my primary interest in Computer Science is operating systems and the security thereof. I'm also interested in software art, esoteric programming, and how to use principles of low level programming to make art that runs on bare metal.

I keep miscellaneous projects and schoolwork on my GitHub account, much of which is private. I keep track of private activity on my profile because it's fun for me to see when I'm doing more or less coding :P

### üòº Skills 
- C / C++
- x86 Assembly
- Typescript

Other languages/tools as needed (Python, Java, JS for webdev, etc.)
