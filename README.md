### Salvete, omnes! 😺
I'm August, a 2nd year Computer Science and Classics student at UMass Amherst!
 
### 🐱 About Me 
I have a diversity of interests (including, besides CS, pedagogy and Augustan era poetry), but my primary interest in Computer Science is operating systems and the security thereof. I have a lot of miscellaneous projects on my GitHub account, most of which are private. I still keep track of the commits for those though, because it's fun for me to see when I'm doing more or less coding :P

### 😼 Skills 
- C / C++
- Typescript
- HTML / CSS / TailwindCSS / Basic web development

Other languages/tools as needed (Python, Java, standard JS, etc.)
